## Things I learned during AoC 2023

  - [i for i in my_str] will get flagged by pylint (day 7)

## Notes On Individual Days

### Day 1

  - Couldn't figure out part 2 without hint.

### Day 3

  - Unusual to be using a custom class this early in the month.

### Day 5

  - Incomplete! I have an idea how to do part 2, but I get tired every time I think of the implementation.

### Day 7

  - I was happy that all of Part 1 was useful for Part 2.
