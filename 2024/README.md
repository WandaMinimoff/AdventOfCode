## Things I learned during AoC 2024


## Notes On Individual Days

### Day 1

  - Started late; took an hour. Stumbled on absolute values. Stumbled on
    strings vs ints. I guess I'm a little rusty.

### Day 3

  - I'm pretty adept at parsing strings, and I'm pretty bad at using regex.
    But when I saw the problem, I knew I would be better off learning regex
    than writing a parser.

    The python re.findall() function was especially useful for this problem.
    I don't recall having used it before, and it made regexes seem easy.

    Some people were tripped up by the input being multiline, but I went
    back to check the instructions, and there wasn't anything in there
    saying it was one line or many lines.
