## Things I learned during AoC 2021

  - Unit tests are critical if you're spreading
    your development over a long period of time.
  - Set is not hashable, but frozenset is.
  - Classes _can_ be hashable by implementing \_\_hash\_\_
  - I learned to use the unpacking operator somewhere along the way; used it
    unironically for day 25.

## Notes On Individual Days

### Day 23

I spent longer on this problem than any other
problem in AoC. It probably also has the largest
file for unit tests. Most of the commits take
place in about a week in March of 2023.

After I was done, I created a cool animation to
show the board being solved; this is included
as the "-a" flag on the command line.
