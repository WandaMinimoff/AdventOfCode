## Advent Of Code

Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge that takes place 
from December 1 through December 25. Like an advent calendar, a new puzzle
is released at midnight (EST, or UTC-5:00) at the
[Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/).

These directories contain, organized by year, some of my solutions in python
for the puzzles. The naming convention for the programs is progYYYYDD.py. If
there are unit tests associated with that day, they will be in the file
testYYYYDD.py. Input data are not included here.

A discussion forum for participants is available on
[Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/adventofcode).
