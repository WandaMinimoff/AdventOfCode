## Advent Of Code

Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge that takes place 
from December 1 through December 25. Like an advent calendar, a new puzzle
is released at midnight (EST, or UTC-5:00) at the
[Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/).

These directories contain, organized by year, some of my solutions in python
for the puzzles.

The naming conventions are:

- progYYYYDD.py - program files
- testYYYYDD.py - unit tests
- dataYYYYDD.txt - expected format for data files

The data files are not included, but you can get your own from the
Advent of Code website.

A discussion forum for participants is available on
[Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/adventofcode).
